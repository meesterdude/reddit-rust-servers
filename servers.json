KOS is not against the rules, it's just not the type of gameplay that we are aiming to create. Blueprints are disabled but research kits are still active, making crafting items a little rarer. F1 Grenades are not craftable fullstop, but C4 is still availible to research and craft. C4 only drops in Supply/Airdrops so be on the lookout however explosives are available to find in many places.",

Before each wipe we'll get a consensus from the server population on the what the theme of the next season will be; primitive weapons only, modern weapons only,less c4, more c4, Arenas... and so forth. This will allow for a different experience, and allow all to get the lead and be King of the Server for a couple of weeks. We feel that this will allow the competition to get stronger and stay stronger.  We've been admins on other servers and can resolve problems quickly and efficiently.

I myself am a responsible admin, and if any questions come up I do stream my games so you know I'm not spawning in items or abusing my powers.

Friday 5PM EST - Saturday 12 PM EST! Airdrops have been modified on the loot table to be more reliable, without just giving stacks of items or gear.
